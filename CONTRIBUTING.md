## Code of Conduct

This project follows `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`. By participating, you agree to abide by it.

## Quickstart (development)

TODO(DEV_SETUP): Document the standard dev setup once the first app/package lands.

## How to contribute

- **Search first**: check existing issues and PRs before opening new ones.
- **Open an issue**: for significant changes, propose the approach in an issue first.
- **Small PRs**: keep PRs focused and reviewable.
- **Tests-first**: this repo requires TDD for production code changes.
- **Coverage**: CI is expected to enforce **≥ 80%** coverage for changed project(s).
- **Security**: do not include secrets; treat LLM prompts/outputs as untrusted input.
