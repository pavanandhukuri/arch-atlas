# Arch Atlas

Web-based tooling for building and evolving **C4 architecture** models and diagrams.

## What this repo is

This is an **open source monorepo**. Expect multiple TypeScript projects (apps + packages) and optional
Python projects for LLM/tool integrations.

## Status

Early stage / under active development.

## Getting started

TODO(QUICKSTART): Add install + run steps once the first app/package lands.

## Repository structure (planned)

- `apps/`: user-facing web applications (C4 editor, viewer, etc.)
- `packages/`: shared libraries (C4 model, renderers, exporters/importers, shared UI)
- `services/`: optional backend services
- `tools/`: scripts and developer tooling
